  Touched by <b>your</b> kindness<br>
What remains, never to disappear, is your warmth 
If <b>I</b> could say that <b>you</b> are dear to <b>me</b><br>
Would <b>my</b> <u>heart</u> become lighter?<br><br>
<br>
On the other side of a closed door<br>
<b>I</b> can hear a faint voice<br>
Unable to move forward, all<b>I</b> can do is<br>
Wallow in loneliness<br>
<br>
My feelings simply live on in this heart<br>
Just like a tiny light so dear that it hurts<br>
<i>So</i> that the wind won’t reach, so that the rain won’t touch<br>
I have held them close, always<br>
<br>
But, the strength to look straight forward and wish with all my heart<br>
And my fragile, crybaby self,<br>
If not for you, I never would have known<br>
Within a happenstance, I found my fate.<br>
<br>
As I continue to close my eyes,<br>
Drifting in a sea of memories<br>
I continue to search for the remnants,<br>
Of the dreams of two people<br>
<br>
You were the person who brought color<br>
To my unchanging, monochrome days<br>
Even this blurred darkness, somehow<br>
I found meaning in it, thanks to you. <br>
<br>
These feelings hidden in my heart<br>
That are so dear to me that it hurts<br>
Before I disappear, one day<br>
I want to convey them, only to you. <br>
<br>
No matter which, my tears or my smiles<br>
They are all for your sake
<br>
My feelings simply live on in this heart<br>
Just like a tiny light so dear that it hurts<br>
So that the wind won’t reach, so that the rain won’t touch<br>
I have held them close, always<br>
<br>
But, the strength to look straight forward and wish with all my heart<br>
And my fragile, crybaby self,<br>
If not for you, I never would have known<br>
Within a happenstance, I found my fate.<br>
My world changed, simply because you were here.</div>
